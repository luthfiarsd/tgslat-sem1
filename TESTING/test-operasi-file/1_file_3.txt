My name is Yoshikage Kira. I am 33 years old. I live in northeast Morioh, where there are many villas... I am not married... I'm an office worker for the Kameyu Department Store. Each evening, I return home no later than 8 PM. I don't smoke. I drink, but only occasionally. I go to bed by 11 PM and always get at least 8 hours of sleep... Before I lie down, I drink a cup of warm milk and do 20 minutes of stretching to relax my body... With that routine, I find that I sleep soundly all the way until morning. Like a baby, I awake with no fatigue or stress. And at my last checkup, I was given a clean bill of health... I'm explaining so that you'll understand that I'm a person who wants to live his live feeling at peace. I refuse to create dilemmas—or enemies—that will disturb my thoughts and keep me up at night worrying if I'll win or lose... And by maintaining that approach toward society, I have found that I can attain happiness. Of course, if I were to fight someone, I would never lose.
